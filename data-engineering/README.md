# Resources for Google Data Engineering Course

## Machine Learning Techniques

### Books

- Andrij is the ML practice lead at Gartner and has written one of the best technical introduction and mid level book on machine learning. [Andrij Burkov - Hundred Page ML Book](http://themlbook.com/)
(was at [Old URL](http://www.mlyearning.org/))
- This has been voted as one of the best technical books for ML with 36 odd models and designs with practical examples all the way from clustering to deep neural networks. [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do)

### Course sites

- This is a resource I have used extensively to learn and practice machine learning techniques on both the supervised and the unsupervised types of machine learning. [Data Camp (Paid Learning)](https://www.datacamp.com/home)
- Kaggle is a competition site with many great resources, bought by Google a few years ago. It is a great place to get sample datasets and ideas around solving real world problems. [Kaggle (Practice)](https://www.kaggle.com/)
